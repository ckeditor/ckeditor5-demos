## Markdown output 🛫

[CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/) can be configured to output Markdown instead of HTML. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting to plain text documents. Use the **Source** button to check and edit the Markdown source code of this content.

The editor-produced Markdown output supports most essential features, like [links](https://ckeditor.com/), **different** kinds of _emphasis_, `inline code formatting`, or code blocks:

```css
p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}
```

## Markdown input 🛬

Thanks to the [autoformatting feature](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/autoformat.html), you can use Markdown syntax when writing. Try it out - use these (or any other) Markdown shortcuts in the editor to format the content on the fly 🚀!

| Inline formatting | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| **Bold** | Type `**` or `__` around your text. |
| _Italic_ | Type `*` or `_` around your text. |
| `Code` | Type `ˋ` around your text. |
| ~Strikethrough~ | Type `~~` around your text. |

Shh! 🤫 Markdown has very basic support for tables. Some advanced table-related features like table or cell styling were disabled in this demo.

## Block formatting

You can also use Markdown to create various text blocks, such as:

*   Block quotes - Start a line with `﹥` followed by a space.
*   Headings:
    1.  Heading 1 - Start a line with `#` followed by a space.
    2.  Heading 2 - Start a line with `##` followed by a space.
    3.  Heading 3 - Start a line with `###` followed by a space.
*   Lists, including nested ones:
    *   Numbered lists - Start a line with `1.` or `1)` followed by a space.
    *   Bulleted lists - Start a line with `*` or `-` followed by a space.
    *   To-do lists - Start a line with `[ ]` or `[x]` followed by a space to insert an unchecked or checked list item.
*   Code blocks - Start a line with `ˋˋˋ`.
*   Horizontal lines - Start a line with `---`
