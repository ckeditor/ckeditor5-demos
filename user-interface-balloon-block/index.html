				<p>
					No trip to India is complete without visiting this spectacular monument,
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New7Wonders_of_the_World"><strong>counted among the Seven Wonders of the World</strong></a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Tourists frequently admit that Taj Mahal "simply cannot be described with words". And that’s probably true. The more you try the more speechless you become. Words give only a semblance of truth. The real truth about its beauty is revealed when you adore
					<strong>different shades of “Taj” depending on the time of the day</strong>
					or when you admire the exquisite inlay work in different corners of the façade.
				</p>

				<h3>Masterpiece of the world’s heritage</h3>

				<p>
					Taj Mahal is a mausoleum built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by Emperor Shah Jahan
					<strong>in the memory of his beloved wife</strong>, Mumtaz Mahal, whose body lies there. It took 20 000 workers to complete and the excellence of this building is visible in every brick.
				</p>

				<p>
					In 1983, Taj Mahal was appointed
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>
					for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".
				</p>

				<p>If you like having a methodology for visiting historical places, here are the four elements on which we recommend to focus your attention:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The tomb</li>
					<li>The decorations</li>
					<li>The garden</li>
					<li>The outlying buildings</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The tomb is what immediately catches your eyesight. The
					<strong>white and soft marble</strong>
					embroidered with stones leaves you totally enchanted.
