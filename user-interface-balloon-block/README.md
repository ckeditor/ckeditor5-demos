# Editor with Balloon Block user interface

CKEditor comes with a variety of editor types and user interface configuration options you can choose from. See all of them in action.

The Balloon Block editor offers the balloon editor with an extra block toolbar which can be accessed using the button attached to the editable content area and following the selection in the document. The toolbar gives access to additional block–level editing features.
