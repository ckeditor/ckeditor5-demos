				<h1>Tidy things up 🧹️ with a customizable toolbar</h1>
				<p>
					CKEditor’s
					<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/toolbar/toolbar.html">toolbar</a>
					lets you mix and match as many (or as few) features as you need. When things get too busy, you can
					<strong>easily group toolbar buttons</strong>. Look, for instance, how this editor’s features are divided into neat groups with
					<code>|</code>
					separators.
				</p>
				<p>
					To unclutter the toolbar even more, you can
					<strong>arrange items into dropdowns</strong>. Use the
					<strong>Lists</strong>
					button above to reveal a menu with different list types.
				</p>
				<h2>Outstanding configurability 👌</h2>
				<p>
					But that’s not all! CKEditor also offers
					<strong>toolbar wrapping</strong>
					: automatic or at a specified breakpoint. This works great with toolbars that do not fit the editor’s width. Additional buttons can either be hidden under a
					<code>⋮</code>
					menu or moved to the next toolbar line.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can even
					<strong>add your own buttons</strong>
					to the toolbar by
