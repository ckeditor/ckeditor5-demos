# Editor with Button Grouping user interface

CKEditor comes with a variety of editor types and user interface configuration options you can choose from. See all of them in action.

The Button Grouping option unclutters the main toolbar by merging buttons into expandable groups. This way you can keep the toolbar concise and well-organized, deciding which buttons should be grouped together.

See this demo live at [ckeditor.com](http://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/editor-types.html#button-grouping) or read more about it in the [CKEditor 5 documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/toolbar/toolbar.html#grouping-toolbar-items-in-drop-downs-nested-toolbars).
