# Editor with classic user interface and menu bar

CKEditor comes with a variety of editor types and user interface configuration options you can choose from. See all of them in action.

The Classic editor offers a toolbar with an editing area placed in a specific position on the page. The toolbar stays visible when you scroll down the page, and the editor grows automatically with the content.

See this demo live at [ckeditor.com](http://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/editor-types.html#classic-with-menu-bar) or read more about it in the [CKEditor 5 documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/examples/builds/classic-editor.html).
