				<h1>The three greatest things you learn from traveling</h1>

				<p>
					Like all the great things on earth traveling teaches us by example.
					Here are some of the most precious lessons I’ve learned over the years
					of traveling.
				</p>

				<h2>Appreciation of diversity</h2>

				<p>
					Getting used to an entirely different culture can be challenging.
					While it’s also nice to learn about cultures online or from books,
					nothing comes close to experiencing cultural diversity in person. You
					learn to appreciate each and every single one of the differences while
					you become more culturally fluid.
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes,
						but having new eyes.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Marcel Proust</strong></p>
				</blockquote>

				<h2>Improvisation</h2>

				<p>
					Life doesn't allow us to execute every single plan perfectly. This
					especially seems to be the case when you travel. You plan it down to
					every minute with a big checklist. But when it comes to executing it,
					something always comes up and you’re left with your improvising
					skills. You learn to adapt as you go. Here’s how my travel checklist
					looks now:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>buy the ticket</li>
					<li>start your adventure</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Confidence</h2>

				<p>
					Going to a new place can be quite terrifying. While change and
					uncertainty make us scared, traveling teaches us how ridiculous it is
					to be afraid of something before it happens. The moment you face your
					fear and see there is nothing to be afraid of, is the moment you
					discover bliss.
